                                There are three types of bee in a honey bee hive: one queen which is in charge of laying eggs and controlling
                                 the population of the hive, a large number of worker bees that are all female and hold various responsibilities 
                                 to maintain the entire hive, and a small number of drones (about 2-3%) that are male and their sole job is to 
                                 mate with queens and spread the genetics of their hive in rare successful mating flights. There are various 
                                 reasons for having a larger than normal number of drones which may cause a hive to collapse. Among the reasons 
                                 for having too many drones are: a bad queen or a worker bee laying unfertilized eggs. It is important that the 
                                 number of drones be monitored carefully as that can provide a good indication of the health of a hive. In order 
                                 to monitor the number of drones, we use a hive monitoring system called Beemon that is created in the Visual 
                                 and Image Processing (VIP) lab in our â€¦
